\begin{abstract}
    Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. This technique is related to the field of parallel computing in the sense that the filters used are highly parallelizable, the pixels transformations are independent of each other. The purpose of this practice is to apply a filter to images of different sizes and analize the response time and speedup using different numbers of threads.
